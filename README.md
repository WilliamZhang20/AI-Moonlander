# AI Moonlander

In this repository, I apply reinforcement learning (RL) to control an agent of a spacecraft to land on the moon in a simulation environment!

The code is written in PyTorch. 

Specifically, I would like to dive into various [policy gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13662) methods.
