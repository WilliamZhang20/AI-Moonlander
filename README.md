# AI Moonlander

In this repository, I apply reinforcement learning (RL) to control an agent of a spacecraft to land on the moon in a simulation environment!

The code is written in PyTorch, using various [policy gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13662) methods, such as REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). 

Demo of a successful landing (of a REINFORCE model):
